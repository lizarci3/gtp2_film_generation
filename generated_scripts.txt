0:  plane on its way back from the Antarctic expedition with its commander, a man named Robert C. Hockney.

After he was arrested on Jan. 7 at the New York Federal Prison, he was transferred to a secure part of the facility at Camp Lejeune. Hockney refused a security check and called on a group of crew that consisted of a handful of members of his crew. Hockney was an Australian citizen who came from a family of Italian and French immigrants known locally as the 'Ossans.' He had just left his home and spent the night watching TV in an asylum-seeker camp. It appears that he didn't see the people of the area but rather those who had been stranded at the other camp, a place where they were supposed to live. This is apparently what happened.

A few days later, Hockney again tried to get an interview by telephone from an interpreter who offered him an opportunity to meet with his group, this time with his interpreter, Robert W. Hall. Hall had given Hockney a short statement, to which Hockney, when told of his request, gave the following answer: 'I am glad that you understand what you're going through and I appreciate the opportunity that you are having. I am a prisoner and the only thing I want for your welfare is a chance to get a look at some of the problems you are dealing with. I don't know if there will be one, but the way you've been treated is just too cruel. I understand that there is the risk you have to return. But I really believe that you are in a very bad place. You should stay, you know. You should think about why your situation isn't right. And remember that every human being has to have a human person in their lives, and I know you can't afford to let any of these people go through things like that."

After the interpreter was finally able to get Hall to speak, Hockney left, only to be detained again by the American embassy as he left his home in Italy on Friday night, July 18. He was flown back to Europe a short time later, but was held until next week, when he was taken by a U.S. marshal to a U.S. Air Force base in Washington, where he was taken to Camp Lemonnier, another United States installation, where he was interrogated for seven hours and was asked to present the following transcript of his interview on Jan. 7:

SCALIFFS: Hi, Colonel.

HARTY: Thanks.

(The interviewer opens)

SCALIFFS: Okay.

HARTY: I got back from a tour with the Americans last week when they were here about 20 minutes and I said to my first friend, I know you'll just have to give me that.

(The interviewer smiles as he answers)

SCALIFFS: You will be taken to Camp Lemonnier the next week. You'll go there to have a conversation about some of this other stuff.

HARTY: Yes.

SCALIFFS: We've got a number of issues going on here.

HARTY: You will have two meetings tomorrow with our other team here and two of your family members. One of those will be here and you're allowed to sit and talk to the American agents.

(The interviewer starts to describe a number of aspects of the interrogation)

(The interpreter asks HARTY which of the three groups he has identified as agents or informants.)

HARTY: One of them is going to the American embassy, which is a prison, as we have to go through a lot of these types of issues with each other. We will come here and sit down and talk about the issues. That's what we want to do because we really hope that you're taking the time to do that.

(A group of four or five agents walks over to HARTY, and the interpreter asks him if he is allowed to sit down again.)

HARTY: Sure.

(The interpreter gives HARTY a small, round, unemotional hug).

HARTY: But you'll be allowed to talk to the American agents or to any of the other crew members that will come down there to sit with you.

HARTY: Not the American people.

(HARTY stares down into the hand of the interpreter's translator, and the interpreter answers)

SCALIFFS: Okay.

HARTY: I have a feeling there aren't any American folks out there that could hold your hands. I'll be okay with that.

(The interpreter smiles slightly)

SCALIFFS: Okay.

HARTY

Input text: Once upon a time there was a dog (ppl 11.332594871520996)

0: Once upon a time there was a dog, she sat down, and the dog took her hand with a little finger, and took off its face.

It was no longer a dog. It was a man's hand, that was still in front of her. When I sat in the street beside the street that same time, it was already too far away to tell me from what direction she was going. But it was no longer a dog.

I was in the same position as she was in the street. I wasn't moving, but I was walking, and I could see the dog.

I was in the corner of the street, and I couldn't hear her, so I couldn't see how she was moving. Then I saw her, and I saw the dog. It was a man's hand. It was just such a man's hand.

I told her to move, but she couldn't. She was holding her hand at that moment, and then she was still holding it, and I could see the dog with my whole eye closed.

And as I looked, I couldn't hear the dogs. All I could do was stand here and wait for her to move away, and then I went.

I was looking at the ground, and I could see what was going on.

I looked round the corner, and I saw what had happened to her. I was still holding my hand as the dog looked away.

I was trying to think. It was the beginning of something that would end there.

0: Once upon a time there was a dog, there was an ewes.

Then a young male leper stepped into the small space, then a leopard.

After that, the beast's back began to creep away.

"Where are they now?" my sister asked me, still looking at him.

"I think the house has been broken into," he answered, looking at me with a pale expression.

After that he stopped and I asked the young man if he had seen them. "They were still down there," he said, smiling.

I looked at him sadly. "So we can get out?" I asked. "It's too dangerous, man."

He didn't seem to know what to say to me.

"I see you could," the young man said, and began to walk away. Then, he stopped to give me a pat on the shoulder.

"Goodbye, sir," I said, and looked down into the empty home where I had just been.

My sister went to find me and saw the young man walking away from me. He was sitting in the middle of the house.

"I'm sorry, I don't understand," the young man said.

"I think he must have thought he was an animal that had escaped his home, he's trying to find food. Perhaps he was looking to get away in this house and try to kill us."

"It's a cruel story," the young man said, and disappeared.

The young man did not look at me and he was not looking away again.

The next day the little leper left, walking across the river.

The young man came again in a single canoe along the shore, in the same canoe, and said to me:

"What does the river have to do with it, then?"

"There's a great deal of water, too. You'll catch some fish. Come along."

"No, no, you don't think so," I said.

He did not go along and he did not swim at all, but I saw him going on about his adventures.

He began to talk to me a little, as if he wanted to get back home.

I did not understand what to think of the strange little young man's story.

Then suddenly my sister asked: "Are you still alive?"

"Yes, but I'm just glad you don't look a lot like me."

When she heard him say this, she said:

"What is your name, if you can speak? I don't mean to look like myself anymore. You must have got a good life."

At that moment my sister suddenly felt the weight of fear, and she ran out of the house with a cry of despair.

I was so sorry. I had never seen such an expression in my life. But now I heard the old man's voice.

"It's all right," he said. "Just let me go."

My sister followed him down the river and found him there too.

And I had the greatest joy about that whole thing. I saw a little baby, a white-haired woman in a long white dress standing alone in the water. She was carrying her two little kids: the little girl had been a little bit sick and her husband was a little bad-tempered, and her baby, an old woman of only three or four months, was still very much in danger of drowning.

My sister sat down in the canoe and watched her child again, all looking away from the river.

She walked across the river, looking out on the land. It was like seeing her face.

"Yes, I remember you, dear girl. I thought I heard you talking. Your life is so strange."

Then she turned to the child and said:

"What do you mean, you know, you can't look at me? I don't see any signs of you."

"I don't like me," I said, "but I see you."

"No, you see me now. I was watching you. I saw you crying, and I think this is very funny because I've never been so much as a part of your life. That is so strange. You don't even know it. They said it was all for a little girl, and it's all my fault."

Then she turned again to the child.

"Now there's a boy named Peter, and you'll tell him. He's a little boy, but he doesn't even know what a man is. If he knew the words, he would have gone to bed, and no one would have
